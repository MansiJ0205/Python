Variables
A variable in Python is like a storage box where you can keep data values. It acts as a label or reference to a specific piece of information. Variables are fundamental to programming as they help store, modify, and retrieve data during the execution of a program.

Key Characteristics of Variables in Python:
Dynamic Typing: You don’t need to declare the type of a variable explicitly. Python infers the type based on the value assigned.

x = 10   # x is an integer
y = "Hello"  # y is a string
z = 3.14  # z is a float


Reassignment: You can change the value of a variable during the program's execution.

x = 10
x = "Now I am a string"

Naming Rules:
Can contain letters (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9), and underscores (_).
Cannot start with a digit.
Cannot be a Python keyword (e.g., if, else, True).
Case-sensitive (my_var and My_Var are different).

Example of Variables:
name = "Alice"
age = 25
height = 5.6
is_student = True

Data Types
A data type defines the kind of value a variable holds. Python provides several built-in data types to handle different types of data.

Common Data Types in Python:

Numeric Types:
int: Integer values (e.g., 56, -7).
float: Decimal numbers (e.g., 2.15, -0.7).
complex: Complex numbers with a real and imaginary part (e.g., 3+4j).

x = 30  # int
y = 2.15  # float
z = 3 + 4j  # complex

Text Type:
str: Sequence of characters enclosed in quotes.
greeting = "Hello, World!"

Boolean Type:
bool: Represents True or False.
is_active = True

Sequence Types:
---------------
list: Ordered, mutable collection of items.
fruits = ["orange", "grapes", "kiwi"]

tuple: Ordered, immutable collection of items.
point = (20, 40)

range: Represents a sequence of numbers.
numbers = range(1, 10)  # From 1 to 9

Mapping Type:

dict: Unordered collection of key-value pairs.
person = {"name": "Ronak", "age": 36}

Set Types:
set: Unordered, mutable collection of unique items.
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 3, 4}
frozenset: Immutable version of a set

a = frozenset([1, 2, 3])
b = frozenset([3, 4, 5])
# Union
print(a | b)  # frozenset({1, 2, 3, 4, 5})
# Intersection
print(a & b)  # frozenset({3})
# Difference
print(a - b)  # frozenset({1, 2})



None Type:
NoneType: Represents the absence of a value.
result = None

Checking Data Type
To find the type of a variable, use the type() function:
x = 10
print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'int'>

Type Casting
Python allows you to convert a variable from one type to another (type casting):
x = 5  # int
y = float(x)  # Convert to float
z = str(x)  # Convert to string

Why Understand Variables and Data Types?
To store and manipulate data effectively.
To write error-free programs by understanding type compatibility.
To optimize memory usage and processing speed.
